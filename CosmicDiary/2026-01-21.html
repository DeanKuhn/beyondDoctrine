                <em>Examining the Scriptures Daily</em><br><br><hr>
                <em>“Do you love Jehovah God, the one who has given you every good gift, even life itself?  Do you want to show your love for him?  The best way to do so is to dedicate yourself to him and then symbolize your dedication by water baptism.  These steps make you part of Jehovah’s family.  As a result, your Father and Friend will guide you and care for you because you will belong to him.  (Ps. 73:24; Isa. 43:1, 2)  Dedication and baptism also give you the prospect of enjoying endless life.  (1 Pet. 3:21)  Is something holding you back from getting baptized?  If so, you are not alone.  Millions before you have had to make changes in their conduct and in their way of thinking in order to qualify for baptism.  They are now serving Jehovah with joy and zeal.”</em><hr><br><br>

This is a stellar example of an appeal to emotions, as well as the bandwagon and generalization fallacies.<br><br>

Take, for example, the first sentence:  <em>“Do you love God?”</em>  Already, Watchtower is framing its argument on the reader’s love of God, and not any logical viewpoint.  Emotions (specifically, <strong>guilt</strong>) are then used, as the paragraph goes on to tell the reader that if they loved God, they should be baptized.  In other words, if you are not baptized, God does not love you.<br><br>

For obvious reasons, this rhetorical fallacy doesn’t need any dismantling.  Reading the passage with an alternate perspective reveals the illogical nature of this claim.  Unfortunately, guilt is a common factor in many appeals to emotion.  Another common factor is <strong>fear</strong>.  And it doesn’t take Watchtower long to include that factor, too.<br><br>

<em>“Dedication and baptism also give you the prospect of enjoying endless life.”</em>  In other words, if Armageddon (a common Watchtower doomsday doctrine) comes and you’re not baptized, you have a much lower chance of being saved compared to a baptized version of yourself.<br>

            <p>
By the next sentence, more fallacies reveal themselves.  <em>“Is something holding you back from getting baptized?  If so, you are not alone.  Millions…”</em>  Here, Watchtower uses a <strong>red herring</strong> to divert attention from genuine problems that may be preventing one from baptism, and instead focuses on the fact that (<strong>bandwagon</strong>) millions of others have dealt with the same thing and have still gotten baptized.  Additionally, it is automatically assumed that, if you aren’t already baptized, something must be holding you back.  Surely, any competent person would already be baptized by now.  This is deceptive and misleading, but very subtle if not noticed immediately.<br><br>

Even worse is what comes next: <em>“Millions before you have had to make changes in their conduct and in their way of thinking in order to qualify for baptism.”</em>  The <strong>assumption</strong> is made that, if you are not yet baptized, something must be wrong with either the reader’s conduct or way of thinking.  This is quite the bold statement!  Again, a deceptive appeal to emotions is being made here to put the thought in the reader’s head that, if I am not baptized yet, there must be something wrong with me.  Unfortunately, this is a very effective strategy.<br><br>

Finally, a case of false <strong>generalization</strong> and <strong>survivorship bias</strong> <em>“They [those who have changed their conduct and thought process] are now serving Jehovah with joy and zeal.”</em>  According to the above statement, every baptized person is serving God with joy and zeal.  Those who are not baptized must therefore be sad and unsuccessful, moping in their rooms right now.  This is illogical and misleading.<br><br>

In a nutshell, without the soft tone and pretty scriptural references, this is what the paragraph is telling you:<br><br><hr>

<em>“Do you love God?  If so, you should be baptized by now.  God does not love those who are not baptized.  Did I mention that if you are not baptized, you probably won’t be saved on the Day of Judgement?  Keep that in mind too…
Since you aren’t baptized, clearly something is wrong with you.  But don’t worry.  Whatever you are going through, millions have already succeeded (by being baptized).  And then, you can be like every other baptized worshipper of God, who are all always joyful!”</em><hr><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
