            <h4>A passage from Ecclesiastes chapter nine.  Taken from the Christian Standard Bible <em>(CSB)</em>.
            </h4>
            
            <p id="paragraph" style="max-width: 600px">
                I have observed that this also is wisdom under the sun, and 
                it is significant to me: There was a small city with few men in it.  A great king 
                came against it, surrounded it, and built large 
                siege works against it. Now a poor wise man was found in the 
                city, and he delivered the city by his wisdom. Yet no one
                 remembered that poor man. And I said, "Wisdom is better than 
                 strength, but the wisdom of the poor man is despised, and 
                 his words are not heeded."
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px" style="max-width: 600px">
                The calm words of the wise are heeded<br>
                more than the shouts of a ruler over fools.<br>
                Wisdom is better than weapons of war,<br>
                but one sinner can destroy much good.
