                How does one know whether or not their thoughts are being controlled by others?<br><br>

The only way to do so is to think about one's own thoughts.  It becomes a sort of paradox.<br><br>

Thoughts are easy to exploit.  Many have been deceived or actively deceive others without even knowing it.  It takes real effort to navigate one’s stream of reason and pinpoint where assumptions and errors are made.  It also takes effort to view authority figures, organizational structures, and regular, habitual events from a different perspective.<br><br>

Naturally, the human mind is allergic to change.  The longer someone has been thinking a certain way, the harder their mind will push when confronted with alternative viewpoints.<br><br>

In brief, if one wishes to know whether their thoughts have been controlled by others, they must undergo a mindful, often uncomfortable journey.  That is what this article focuses on today.  In particular, this article will focus on the religion of Jehovah’s Witnesses.  <br><br>

Jehovah’s Witnesses are known for their tight, centralized structure and strict requirements for religious adherence.  They are also known for their mandated shunning of those who commit sin (that is, whatever Watchtower declares a sin) unrepentantly, or who promote apostate (again, whatever Watchtower views as “apostate”) worship.<br><br><hr>

<strong>What is a rhetorical fallacy?</strong><br><br>

To put it simply, rhetorical fallacies are errors or assumptions made in reasoning that are meant to weaken an opponent's argument by deceiving the audience.  Often, rhetorical fallacies appeal to emotion, the desire to appease authority figures, and involve faulty logic that, in the moment, appears sound.<br>

<a class="plug" href="CosmicDiary/listofRF.html">A list of common rhetorical fallacies can be found here</a>
<p>
Each of these rhetorical fallacies (and more!) can be found bountifully within Watchtower publications.  And that is not an exaggeration!  Let it be proven.  Most of the quotes obtained will be excerpts from the book Examining the Scriptures Daily.  However, underlying ideas/motives will be commented on only when they have already been showcased through quoted proof.
