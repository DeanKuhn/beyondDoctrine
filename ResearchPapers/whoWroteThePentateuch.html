            <h1>Who Wrote the First Five Books of the Bible?</h1>
            <h4 style="max-width: 600px">Unfortunately, the answer is not as simple as "Moses did".</h4>
            <p>
                It did not take scholars long to realize that Moses did not write the first five books of the Bible.  In fact, most modern historians heavily doubt his existence.<br><br>

                This fantasy of a lone prophet with good penmanship collapsed the moment people noticed blatant contradictions, repeating stories, different names for God, and an obsessive fixation on entirely different things in different paragraphs throughout the Pentateuch.  One popular theory explaining the authorship of this Bible section, which emerged in the 20th century, was the Documentary Hypothesis. This embarrassingly simple hypothesis has been dismantled about as thoroughly as the "Moses wrote it all" interjection. However, its underlying components are still helpful in explaining why most scholars reject the Torah as having a single author.<br><br>

                The Documentary Hypothesis attempts to cleanly dissect the Pentateuch into four major styles of writing (each style being referred to by a capital letter):
                J, E, P, and D.<br><br><hr>

                J, the Yahwist, is considered the oldest voice.  Likely, this writer lived south, around Judah.  The author used God's personal name, YHWH, and wrote about God as if he were a person.  God forms humans with His hands; He gets frustrated with human incompetence. God regrets, negotiates, smells sacrifices, and talks to people face to face.

                J  is a huge fan of stories.  Not rules.  Abraham, Jacob, Joseph.  The Big Three (sorry, Isaac, but nothing interesting happened in your life).  The tone is earthy, dramatic, and unconcerned with theological polish.  Take, for example, Genesis 2 (starting in verse 4, notice the shift in interlinear copies from 'elohim' as 'God' to 'YWHW') and 3.  God is creating Adam again (after God did so in chapter 1).  This time, God notices that Adam is not doing too well alone.  So he creates Eve.  Adam sings a beautiful poem.  Lovely.

                Chapter three.  Things get tense.  Saten tempts Eve.  Adam rebels.  God strolls in, sees humans arguing, figures things out, and delivers consequences with narrative flair instead of legal formality.

                J has a pretty clear agenda.  God chose Judah's ancestors, and the world makes sense through that family line.  Theology is relational, not abstract.

                <br><br><hr>

                Fast forward to E, the Elohist.

                E shows up later and sounds more anxious, more distant.  Many scholars pinpoint E as residing in northern Israel.  In E's writings, God is not as close and personal as He is in J's. God speaks through dreams, angels, or intermediaries.  The divine name Elohim is used until the burning bush episode, where God supposedly reveals His name to His servants (again?).

                With E around, fear of God matters.  Prophets matter.  Moral testing matters.  Abraham almost sacrificing Isaac is a signature E moment.  Emotionless.  Almost cruelly obedient.  If Abraham argued about the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (clearly wicked cities), why wouldn't he question God at least once before sacrificing his own son?

                Notice, too, that it is an angel who intervenes in Abraham's sacrifice, not God directly.  While no passage in Genesis can be clearly defined as "from chapter 2 to 6 is J, and then 7 to 13 is E", specific passages carry the vibe of completely different writers.  E's coldness does not match up with J's vivid, concrete tone at all.  E smells a little too strongly of northern politics and prophetic authority.

                P, the priestly source, is the one to blame for those long nights trying to get through the second half of Exodus, the majority of Leviticus, and a good portion of Numbers.

                P's contribution to the Pentateuch was likely written during the Jewish exile or soon afterwards.  P had a very particular coping mechanism to his nation's destruction and enslavement.

                He wrote rules.  He gave God cosmic status.  Orderly, neat, and unreachable.  God does not touch, walk, or improvise.  Everything is measured, counted, and regulated.  Genealogies explode across the page; Sabbaths, circumcision, purity laws, and ritual precision dominate.  Emotion replaces structure.  Oddly enough, the theme of P's writings is fitting for his time period.

                P is the bureaucrat who shows up after everything has burned down.  The theme of his writing is survival through identity.  If one can control ritual, lineage, and law, one can still exist even when their homeland is gone.

                <br><br><hr>

                D, the Deuteronomist, is not subtle and does not care if anyone notices.  D wrote a sermon and tried to sneak it in under the guise of "this is the second law, but also genuine history."

                Unsurprisingly, Deuteronomy is the signature of D's writing.  D likely wrote his contribution to the Pentateuch around the time Josiah ripped his garments apart (as the word of God was found and read before him).  Maybe, he thought, it needed some updates.  And a little more positivity.

                Centralization of worship is D's obsession: one God, one sanctuary, and one correct way to obey.  Blessings follow obedience.  Disaster follows disobedience.  Deuternonomy chapter 28 is a perfect example of this.

                D is a stickler for repetition, exhortation, and phrases like "with all your heart and soul."  God is less a character and more a moral engine.  The agenda is national survival through covenant loyalty.

                <br><br><hr>

                In summary, it does not take much for the cracks in the Pentateuch's "one author" stance to show.  Two creation stories.  Two very different names for God.  Two contrasting flood timelines.  Different covenant styles.  In one chapter, Abraham argues with God over the fate of ten men.  Lot asks for a detour.  In another instance, Joseph interprets dreams and advises Pharaoh secondhand.

                Leviticus transitions from regulating the amount of fabrics one can wear on one's clothes to Deuteronomy, which provides warm yet threatening pep talks.

                The Pentateuch is Israel thinking out loud for centuries, revising God as history kept punching them in the gut.

                Scholarly consensus today is not that there were four distinct writers of the Pentateuch.  It is best to understand J, E, P, and D as traditions, themes, writing styles, and editorial layers fused by later redactors.  These scribes did their best to compile these writings smoothly into what is now known as the first five books of the Bible.

                No one knows precisely who wrote which section of the Pentateuch, or exactly when J, E, P, or D decided to write each section.  There is constant debate over which writing school wrote what part of the Bible.  Over centuries of writing, editing, compiling, and scribes taking the Bible's theology into their own hands, the Pentateuch is a complex and confusing mix of competing agendas, writing styles, and theological assumptions.
