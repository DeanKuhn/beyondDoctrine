            <h4 style="max-width: 600px;">The purpose of this writing is ultimately to determine the true date for the destruction of the ancient city of Jerusalem.</h4>

            <p style="max-width: 600px;">Almost all modern-day historians point to ~587 BCE as the year ancient Jerusalem was destroyed.  Jehovah’s Witnesses claim that the Bible points to 607 BCE as the year of Jerusalem’s destruction.  There is great debate on this matter, involving both the legitimacy of historical artifacts unearthed and the interpretation of key biblical scriptures surrounding this destruction.</p>

            <p style="max-width: 600px;">
                To minimize the bias found within sources on these matters, an LLM (large language model) will be used (OpenAI’s ChatGPT).  By utilizing a source designed to handle conflicting and biased information, this paper aims to approach as closely as possible an unbiased answer to the question of when ancient Jerusalem was truly destroyed.<br><br>
                A background will be given showcasing historical evidence found, what date they point to regarding Jerusalem’s destruction, as well as why Jehovah’s Witnesses point to 607 BCE as the year of Jerusalem’s destruction.  Key Bible verses will also be cited.

            <hr>

            <p style="max-width: 600px;">BACKGROUND: Thousands of historical artifacts have been unearthed from the Neo-Babylonian era (626 BCE-539 BCE), which together form a chronology of that time.  In fact, the Neo-Babylonian era is considered one of the best-documented phases of Mesopotamian history.  Consider some lines of evidence found:<br>

            <h4>VAT 4956</h4>

            <p style="max-width: 600px;">Tablet VAT 4956 is an astronomical diary that records 13 lunar observations and 15 planetary observations, all of which align with the years 568/567 BCE.  The tablet is dated to the 37th year of King Nebuchadnezzar, which would place Nebuchadnezzar’s 18th regnal year, the year of Jerusalem’s destruction, around 587/586 BCE.  “When an ancient record with that many precise observations, all of which agree with the best available astronomical calculations, is available, there is little or no room for doubt as to the exact timing of Nebuchadnezzar’s 37th year of reign” (Gunnar Anders Smars Jr).
            Some argue that, because the original Babylonian tablet was copied during the Seleucid period (c. 300s BCE), it cannot be trusted.  Some argue that the Seleucids altered the dates on the tablet to conform to their beliefs about ancient chronology.  Keep in mind that this tablet recorded “21 or more very precise observations of celestial events” (Gunnar Anders Smars Jr).  If the Seleucids wanted to change the year of Nebuchadnezzar’s 37th regnal year of reign, they would have also needed to change the celestial observations noted on the tablet so that they would fit with their changed chronology.  Without the use of modern-day technology, the calculations for these astronomical observations would have been nearly impossible.<br><br>

            Jehovah’s Witnesses, in their two-part article series “When Was Ancient Jerusalem Destroyed?” claim that the observations in the VAT 4956 fit the year 588 BCE better than 567/568 BCE (Jehovah’s Witnesses) (this would push the date of Jerusalem’s destruction back 20 years, landing on 607 BCE).  They highlight what would appear to be an error made in the original translation of the tablet by Neugebauer and Weidner, claiming that the original tablet’s text points to the date Nisan 9 in a lunar observation, fitting the year 588 BCE better than the translated “mistake” reading Nisan 8, which fits 568 BCE.<br><br>
            While this is a valid point, it overlooks the 15 planetary observations also included on VAT 4956.  Planetary observations, unlike lunar observations, are robust anchors in history – they move more slowly and are much harder to pinpoint to more than one specific year.  They are essentially a cosmic timestamp.<br><br>

            All 15 of VAT 4956’s planetary observations point to a single year in history: 568 BCE.  There is no room for error, especially when considering a year as far back as 588 BCE.  A single potential mistake, Nisan 8 vs Nisan 9, is much easier to chalk up to a scribal error or minor discrepancy than invalidating 15 highly accurate planetary observations.<br><br>

            Tablet VAT 4956 is one of several ancient astronomical tablets unearthed during and around the Neo-Babylonian era that point to ~587 BCE as the year of Jerusalem’s destruction.  This individual tablet was highlighted because it is by far the most popular and debated tablet of this time period, as well as for its accuracy in pinpointing the date of Jerusalem’s destruction.<br>


            <h4>Ancient economic/administrative and legal documents</h4>

            <p style="max-width: 600px;">Tens of thousands of economic, administrative, and legal documents have been recovered from the Neo-Babylonian period.  Many of these texts can be found on the ORACC website, allowing users to translate and compare them directly.<br><br>

            “A large number of dated tablets are extant from each year during this whole period. The length of reign of each king may, then, be established by these documents, sometimes almost to the day… The business and administrative documents are original documents, contemporary with the Neo-Babylonian era itself, which makes this line of evidence exceedingly strong. These documents definitely point to 587/86 B.C.E. as Nebuchadnezzar’s eighteenth regnal year, when he desolated Jerusalem” (Jonsson, 150).
            The thousands of tablets found throughout the Neo-Babylonian era give no room for 20 years of undocumented history to be added.  While it is true that many of these tablets contain scribal errors, and a handful of them have proven to be copies, a broader perspective is essential.  Every single year from Nabopolassar to Nebuchadnezzar to Amel-Marduk to Neriglissar to Nabonidus is filled with dated economic and legal tablets.  It cannot be emphasized enough.  There is no room for a single year to be added; nonetheless, 20 additional years.  Because most texts are dated by king, regnal year, month, and day, these tablets are highly resistant to wholesale corruption, which is what adding 20 years to this period would involve.<br><br>

            <strong>Comparing the chronology of the Egyptian Saite Period with the Neo-Babylonian Era</strong><br><br>
            Perhaps the most independent source to cement a nation’s chronology is by comparison of the chronology of an entirely separate nation.  This will be accomplished by comparing the chronology of the Egyptian Saite Dynasty with that of the Neo-Babylonian Era.<br><br>

            The chronology for the Egyptian Saite period is found through a rather interesting means.  Egyptians kept what is known as a holy Apis bull, a bull that they believed was a physical representation of one of their many gods.  What makes these bulls special is the fact that, when they died, a stele, or gravestone, was constructed for them with the day, month, and regnal year of the current king.<br><br>

            <em>“Many of the inscriptions include the names of the pharaohs who ruled during an Apis bull’s lifetime, as well as the bull’s birth date, death date, and life span. These texts have enabled scholars to date securely the reigns of Egyptian pharaohs—and any other rulers with whom those pharaohs were in contact—back to 664 B.C.” (Depuydt).</em><br><br>
            The start of the Saite period, or 26th dynasty, can be confidently set to 525 BCE as the year in which the Persians, under Cambyses, overtook Egypt.  From here, we simply work our way backwards from the reigns of kings given to us by the stelae.  To explore whether these reigns synchronize with the Neo-Babylonian chronology, a scripture will be used:<br><br>
            <em>“For Egypt, concerning the army of Pharaoh Necho the king of Egypt, who was along the Euphrates River and was defeated at Carchemish by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, the king of Judah:” – Jeremiah 46:2 (NWT)</em><br><br>

            If one were to use 607 BCE as the date of Jerusalem’s destruction, this would place the battle of Carchemish in 625 BCE, as is given on page 1268 of Volume 1 of Insight on the Scriptures.  Unfortunately, this would not align with the chronologies provided for both Babylon and Egypt; Nebuchadnezzar’s reign began around 605 BCE, and Necho II’s (the same Necho referred to in Jeremiah) reign began around 610 BCE.  This would also align with evidence that King Nebuchadnezzar defeated King Necho II in his first year of rule over Babylon.<br><br>

            While the chronology for the 26th dynasty of Egypt is still debated regarding the exact years of each king’s reign, there is no room to add 20 years, especially if one wants to push the Battle of Carchemish back by 20 years.<br><br>

            <strong>SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE:</strong><br><br>
            It may be noticed that the lines of evidence chosen for this writing are peculiar.  From a singular astronomical tablet to the gravestones of Egyptian “god-bulls,” it could still be argued that this does not provide concrete evidence for the date of Jerusalem’s destruction.<br><br>
            Yet, these lines of evidence are three of dozens of other lines of evidence that point to ~587 BCE as the year of Jerusalem’s destruction.  Keep in mind, too, that these are three completely independent lines of evidence.  One does not depend upon the other.
            It has been argued that chronologies given to us from ancient historians and astronomers, such as Ptolemy’s Canon, cannot be completely trusted.  However, it is much harder to brush off a tablet such as VAT 4956 that accurately lines up 15 planetary observations to a specific year, tens of thousands of ancient legal, administrative, and economic tablets that don’t allow a single year of wiggle room for missing/undocumented years in ancient Babylon’s chronology, and a completely separate nation’s chronology that accurately lines up to Babylon’s chronology through separate means of evidence.<br><br>
            Assuming that these lines of evidence are correct, it may be wondered if this evidence contradicts what the Bible says.  A closer examination of these prophetic verses is warranted.<br><br>

            <strong>WHAT DOES THE BIBLE REALLY SAY?</strong><br><br>
            <em>“The hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father with spirit and truth.”</em> - John 4:23 (NWT)<br><br>
            <strong>Jeremiah 25:11</strong> says,<br><br>
            <em>“And all this land [Judah] will be reduced to ruins and will become an object of horror, and these nations will have to serve the king of Babylon for 70 years.” (NWT)
            Upon first glance, it appears as if Judah becoming “reduced to ruins,” or desolated, is to last 70 years.  Yet, there is more to this scripture than meets the eye at first.
            Notice first that the desolation of Jerusalem is not equated with 70 years in any sense.  Rather, 70 years is given for the time “these nations will have to serve the king of Babylon.”</em><br><br>

            Observe, too, that these 70 years are not in reference to just Judah.  Jeremiah 25:9 says,<br><br>
            <em>“I [Jehovah] am… sending for King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, my servant, and I will bring them against this land and against its inhabitants and against all these surrounding nations.”</em> (NWT)<br><br>

            This makes more sense later on, when it is stated in verse 11 that “these nations will have to serve the king of Babylon for 70 years.”  While a desolation of Jerusalem was prophesied, the 70 years referred to “all these surrounding nations” as well as Judah and their servitude to Babylon.<br><br>

            A keyword to consider in this verse is “serve.”  The 70-year prophecy in Jeremiah does not refer to the desolation of a single nation, but rather to the Babylonian subjection of Judah and the surrounding nations.  The historical context of this interpretation will be considered later.<br><br>

            <strong>Jeremiah 29:10</strong> is a popular verse often cited in support of the 70 years of desolation.  It reads,<br><br>
            <em>“For this is what Jehovah says, ‘When 70 years at Babylon are fulfilled, I will turn my attention to you, and I will make good on my promise by bringing you back to this place.’”</em> (NWT)<br><br>

            Jehovah’s Witnesses claim that, by using the word “at,” Jeremiah is referring to 70 years of Jewish exile in Babylon.  This would indicate that Jerusalem had to have been destroyed for 70 years.<br><br>
            Of utmost importance in this verse is, then, how this word is translated.  A literal translation of the first two phrases goes as so:<br><br><strong><em> כִּי־כֹה אָמַר יְהוָה – “For thus says YHWH”, כִּי לְפִי מְלֹאת לְבָבֶל שִׁבְעִים שָׁנָה – “For according to the fulfilling for Babylon seventy years”</em></strong><br><br>
            (provided by OpenAI’s ChatGPT)<br><br>

            Hebrew scholar Ernst Jenni had to say about this preposition, <br><br><em>“The rendering in all modern commentaries and translations is ‘for Babel’ (Babel as world power, not city or land); this is clear from the language as well as also from the context”</em> (Die hebräischen Präpositionen. Band 3: Die Präposition Lamed, 109) (translated from German).<br><br>

            Another factor to consider is the context of this verse.  Jeremiah is appealing to the current Jewish exiles in Babylon during the reign of King Zedekiah, likely around the same time as the previous chapter, which would place us around 595/94 BCE, or, according to Jehovah’s Witnesses, around 615/14 BCE.  Jeremiah uses the 70-year prophecy as a source of encouragement, telling them that once these 70 years are fulfilled, Jehovah had promised to free them from the Babylonian exile.<br><br>

            Using the 70 years as a source of encouragement would make no sense if the 70 years had not begun, as would be the case in the Watchtower’s chronology.  Rather, Jeremiah, seeing that the 70 years of Babylonian exile had already begun (through Babylonian subjection), used this prophecy to comfort the exiled Jews, reminding them that their exile would not last forever.<br><br>
            Also of note is the fact that Jehovah’s promises of bringing the Jews “back to this place” are never connected to the 70-year prophecy of Babylonian servitude.  Rather, this return is to take place “when the seventy years at/for Babylon are fulfilled.  The cross-referenced scripture in Jeremiah 29:10 concerning this phrase leads to Jeremiah 24:6, which doesn’t mention that 70 years of desolation will be ended by an immediate return to Jerusalem.<br><br>

            It seems logical to conclude that these 70 prophetic years of Babylonian supremacy would end at Babylon’s downfall, which occurred in 539 BCE (a date agreed upon by Jehovah’s Witnesses and secular historians), and that pushing the end of this 70-year prophecy to the complete Jewish return ~537 BCE would make the above statement in Jeremiah 29:10 inaccurate.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Daniel 9:1 & 2,</strong><br><br>
            <em>“In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus–a descendant of the Medes who had been made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans–in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, discerned by the books the number of years mentioned in the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet to fulfill the desolation of Jerusalem, namely, 70 years.”</em><br><br>

            <hr>
            <p style="max-width: 600px;">
                **Subpoint (edited in on 12/15/25)**<br><br>
                When I first wrote this paper, I was not aware that the book of Daniel was more than likely written by an anonymous Jew in the 2nd century BCE.  The book was meant to encourage the Jewish people, who were then living under an oppressive rulership; it was not meant to be a record of real historical accounts. Daniel (at least, the character portrayed in the book) almost certainly never existed (if you would like evidence to back this statement, check out my article <em><a style="text-decoration: none;" href="/ResearchPapers/bibleAuthorship.thml" >Who Really Wrote the Bible?</a></em>).<br><br>

                With that being said, any passage taken from the book of Daniel, whether used to defend 607 BCE as the year of Jerusalem's destruction or to prove greater fulfillment of prophecies recorded within, should be taken with a grain of salt.</p><br>

                <hr>

                <p style="max-width: 600px;">
            While it again appears that Daniel likens the 70-year prophecy to the desolation of Jerusalem, it is essential to examine the context of this verse, as well as Daniel's subsequent prayer on behalf of Israel.<br><br>

            Since Daniel never prayed for a clarified understanding of this prophecy, it is likely that Daniel fully understood what the 70-year prophecy entailed for Judah.  Daniel’s prayer, then, would be fitting as to how he understood the prophecy to be fulfilled.<br><br>

            Daniel’s prayer is recorded in King Darius’s first year, after Darius had conquered Babylon.  Daniel understood that after the 70 years for Babylon had been fulfilled, Jehovah promised to bring His people back to Jerusalem, but only if they returned to Him and followed His commandments.  Daniel prayed deeply for the forgiveness of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and for Jehovah to show mercy towards them.<br><br>

            Daniel likely discerned that the symbolic period of Babylonian subjection had ended, and that now it was Jehovah’s time to turn his attention back to his people and to bring them back to their homeland, as he had promised in Jeremiah 29:10, once the 70 years had been fulfilled.<br><br>

            This return did not specify a return date.  So Daniel, likely in an effort to gain Jehovah’s favor upon his exiled people, prayed for forgiveness, so that Jehovah would permit a return to Jerusalem soon.<br><br>

            Some modern translations choose to interpret this verse for Daniel, presenting him as saying, <br><br><em>“I understood from the Scriptures... that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years”</em> (NIV).  <br><br>
            
            Yet, a literal translation of this verse (as well as what can be found in the NWT) does not make it clear whether Daniel had in mind the 70 years being already fulfilled (with a promised release coming shortly) or the 70 years actually referring to Jerusalem’s desolation.  It simply cannot be deciphered from Daniel’s direct words.  Interpretation is necessary.  Yet, keep in mind that the direct prophecy comes from Jeremiah, and not from Daniel.  And that, while Daniel provides no favor to either interpretation, the content of his prayer and its timing give a better idea of how Daniel truly interpreted Jeremiah’s prophecy.<br><br>

            <strong>2 Chronicles 36:20-22,</strong><br><br>
            <em>“He carried off captive to Babylon those who escaped the sword, and they became servants to him and his sons until the kingdom of Persia began to reign, to fulfill Jehovah’s word spoken by Jeremiah, until the land had paid off its sabbaths.  All the days it lay desolate it kept sabbath, to fulfill 70 years.  In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia, in order that Jehovah’s word spoken by Jeremiah would be fulfilled, Jehovah stirred the spirit of King Cyrus of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his kingdom…”</em> (NWT)<br><br>
            Yet again, at a glance, Ezra appears to confirm that Jerusalem had to lie desolate for 70 years.  As has been seen before, a deeper reading of this passage is necessary to determine what he truly meant.<br><br>

            Starting in verse 20, Ezra states that <br><br>
            <em>“they [the Jews] became servants to him and his sons until the kingdom of Persia began to reign, to fulfill Jehovah’s word spoken by Jeremiah, until the land had paid off its sabbaths.”</em><br><br>  
            
            Ezra highlights the subjection Babylon had over the Jews, which aligns with Jeremiah’s prophecy recorded in Jeremiah 25:11. Ezra also notes how the land kept its sabbaths while it lay desolate.  This is not in reference to any prophecy recorded in Jeremiah, but rather, to a separate prophecy recorded in Leviticus.<br><br>
            Leviticus 26:34 foretells that, if ever a time comes when Jehovah chooses to punish his people for not keeping his commandments (specifically the law of the sabbatical years), he will scatter his people among the nations, and make the nation of Israel a desolate wasteland.  That way, the nation would lie desolate while it pays off its sabbaths, as Ezra brought out.  Of importance is the fact that not once is the time given for paying off sabbaths likened to 70 years.<br><br>

            While Ezra appears to connect that time to 70 years, he does not do so explicitly.  Rather, he connects a prophecy from Leviticus to the prophecy found in Jeremiah, which actually mentions the 70 years, specifically that of Babylonian supremacy.<br><br>
            Another point brought out by Jehovah’s Witnesses and some scholars is that verses 22 and 23 of 2 Chronicles 36 seem to end the 70-year prophecy, not at the destruction of Babylon, but rather at the proclamation of King Cyrus, declaring that the Jews are free to return to Jerusalem and build a temple.<br><br>

            To counter this line of reasoning, consider verses 20 and 21.  Here, Ezra lines up the fulfillment of the 70-year prophecy with the Persian overthrow of Babylon.  <br><br>
            
            <em>“They became servants to him and his sons until the kingdom of Persia began to reign, to fulfill Jehovah’s word spoken by Jeremiah</em> (cross-reference Jeremiah 25:9)<em>, until the land had paid off its sabbaths</em> (cross-reference Leviticus 26:34)<em>.  All the days it lay desolate it kept sabbath, to fulfill 70 years </em>(cross reference Jeremiah 25:12, Zechariah 1:12 (this verse will be discussed next)) (all cross-references come from the NWT).<br><br>
            Notice how the cross-references cite Jeremiah 25:12 in relation to the fulfillment of the 70-year prophecy.  Jeremiah had clearly stated that these 70 years were a period during which <br><br><em>“these nations will have to serve the king of Babylon for 70 years”</em> (Jeremiah 25:11). <br><br>
            
            Additionally, notice how Leviticus stands out as a separate prophecy regarding the repayment of sabbaths, which never mentions 70 years of specific desolation.<br><br>
            At first glance, Ezra appears to join the desolation of the land and 70 years together as one idea.  If historical chronology is to be considered, likely, Ezra is actually reciting how both Jeremiah’s prophecy of 70 years of servitude was coincided by a desolation of Jerusalem, which allowed for a sabbath rest, and ended, not after 70 years of desolation, but after the 70 years of Jeremiah’s prophecy was fulfilled by the Persian conquest.<br><br>

            <strong>Zechariah 1:12, 7:5,</strong> NWT<br><br>
            <em>“So the angel of Jehovah said: ‘O Jehovah of armies, how long will you without your mercy from Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with whom you have been indignant these 70 years?’”<br><br>
            “Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, ‘When you fasted and wailed in the fifth month and in the seventh month for 70 years, did you really fast for me?’”</em><br><br>

            While both of these verses do mention a period of 70 years (likely in reference to the one Jeremiah foretold), nowhere do the angel of Jehovah or Jehovah himself (the ones speaking these verses) indicate that these 70 years were in reference to Jerusalem’s desolation.  Instead, they are likely using the 70 years in an encouraging sense, acknowledging that the period of Babylonian subjection is over and that Jehovah has fulfilled his promise to bring his people back to Judah.<br><br>

            As previously pointed out by Ezra, the 70-year prophecy conceptually concludes with the fall of Babylon to Cyrus and then Cyrus’ decree for the Jews to rebuild the temple.
            Again, the book of Zechariah bears no evidence as to whether the 70 years were literal years of desolation or years of subjection.  To conclude that this book proves full desolation would be an overinterpretation of the scriptures.<br><br>




            <strong>SUMMARY OF SCRIPTURAL EVIDENCE GIVEN</strong><br><br>

            While it is true that the original 70-year prophecy found in Jeremiah 25:11 does foretell Jerusalem’s desolation, it only explicitly ties the 70 years to Babylonian subjection over Judah and the surrounding nations.<br><br>
            Jeremiah 29:10 supports this claim and adds that after these 70 years had already been fulfilled, Jehovah promised to bring His people back to their homeland.  Keep in mind, too, that the preposition of much debate found within this verse is directly translated as “for/to/concerning,” not “at.”  “At” is an interpretive stretch of the direct prepositional translation.<br><br>
            Daniel 9:1 & 2 highlights how Daniel likely discerned that the 70 years had been, for the most part, fulfilled, and that now it was time for Jehovah’s promise of restoration to come into play.  Daniel’s prayer makes more sense this way.<br><br>
            Ezra’s words, found at the conclusion of 2 Chronicles, also point to a clear understanding that Jeremiah’s prophecy of 70 years of Babylonian subjection had been fulfilled by the conquest by Persia.  Ezra chose to tie in the sabbatical prophecy found in Leviticus 26:34 to Jerusalem’s desolation; however, it is likely that Ezra meant no connection between this prophecy and the 70-year prophecy recorded in Jeremiah.<br><br>
            Finally, while the book of Zechariah mentions 70 years twice (likely in reference to the 70-year prophecy recorded in Jeremiah), the book itself contains no conclusive evidence linking this prophecy to Babylonian subjection or literal desolation.<br><br>
            In conclusion, while a straightforward reading of the Bible suggests that the 70-year prophecy is likened to Jerusalem’s desolation, most modern scholars interpret these verses in light of historical evidence.  Therefore, the 70-year prophecy in Jeremiah is generally understood as a symbolic period of Babylonian dominance over Judah and the surrounding nations, marking a time of exile and subjection rather than a precise period of continuous desolation.<br><br>

            <strong>IS THIS CONCLUSION HISTORICALLY ACCURATE?</strong><br><br>

            Yes.  As previously stated, Nebuchadnezzar defeated King Necho II of Egypt at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BCE, marking a significant period of dominance over the land.  This allowed Nebuchadnezzar to impose vassalage on Judah and other surrounding nations.  In addition to Babylon’s crucial victory over Egypt, 605 BCE is also recognized by historians as the year when the first Jewish exiles were taken into captivity in Babylon (compare Daniel 1:1-6 and 2 Chronicles 36:5-7).<br><br>
            The <em>Insight Book</em> claims that the Battle of Carchemish occurred 20 years earlier, in 605 BCE.  This is not historically possible.  The VAT 4956 clearly anchors Nebuchadnezzar’s 37th year to ~568 BCE, which would make his first year ~605 BCE.  And Egyptian stelae give King Necho II a reign spanning from ~610 BCE to ~595 BCE.<br><br>
            One may wonder, then, whether the Battle of Carchemish established Babylon’s period of dominance over Judah and the surrounding lands. If Persia conquered Babylon in 539 BCE, this would only allow for ~66 years of symbolic Babylonian subjection, not 70.<br><br>
            This is true.  And unfortunately, there is not much wiggle room to stretch these numbers if one wants to favor a span of 70 literal years of Babylonian power.<br><br>
            As has been made clear, 605 BCE and 539 BCE are two well-cemented dates in history.  And scripture highlights that, likely, the Persian conquest is what fulfilled the 70-year prophecy.  Based on historical facts and a Biblical interpretation favored by most scholars, it can again be concluded that the 70 years Jeremiah prophesied regarding Babylonian subjection are symbolic, marking a time of exile and subjection.  They do not necessarily point to 70 literal years.<br><br>
            Some point to 609 BCE (the year King Josiah died) as the year in which Babylonian subjection began.  Others point to the Jewish return ~537 BCE as its fulfillment.  While these interpretations get the prophecy closer to 70 years, they also stretch interpretations and are not reliant on the most direct readings of scripture.<br><br>
            While the fact that Jeremiah's prophecy likely did not cover a literal 70-year period may be disappointing to some, most historians agree that a Persian conquest of Babylon seemed impossible at the time.  Babylon was a world power.  To give an approximate prediction as to how long its reign of subjection over Judah would last, and to have that prediction come true within a few years, is beyond the accuracy that any human could give.<br><br>

            <strong>WHY DO JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES POINT TO 1914 AS THE YEAR IN WHICH CHRIST BEGAN HIS KINGDOM REIGN?</strong><br><br>


            A clear explanation that answers this question can be found in the article <em>“What Does Bible Chronology Indicate About the Year 1914?”</em> (Jehovah’s Witnesses).  A summary will be given briefly:<br><br>

            Daniel 4 relates a prophecy involving King Nebuchadnezzar.  First, King Nebuchadnezzar had a dream of a tall and prosperous tree being cut down, bound with iron and copper, and then allowed to grow again after seven times.  This prophecy’s fulfillment came true when Nebuchadnezzar became insane, dwelt with the beasts of the field for seven times, and then, once these seven times were over, became King again over Babylon.
            The purpose of this prophecy is made clear in Daniel 4:17 (NWT), where it states that this prophecy was given <br><br>
            
            <em>“so that people living may know that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind and that he gives it to whomever he wants, and he sets up over it even the lowliest of men.”</em><br><br>
            Jehovah’s Witnesses claim that this prophecy has a greater fulfillment.  Their argument goes as follows:<br><br>

            <em>“Was proud Nebuchadnezzar the one to whom God ultimately wanted to give such rulership? No, for God had earlier given him another prophetic dream showing that neither he nor any other political ruler would fill this role. Instead, God would himself ‘set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed.’”​—Daniel 2:31-44<br><br>
            “Previously, God had set up a kingdom to represent his rulership on earth: the ancient nation of Israel. God allowed that kingdom to be made “a ruin” because its rulers had become unfaithful, but he foretold that he would give kingship to “the one who has the legal right.” (Ezekiel 21:25-​27) The Bible identifies Jesus Christ as the one legally authorized to receive this everlasting kingdom. (Luke 1:​30-​33) Unlike Nebuchadnezzar, Jesus is “lowly in heart,” just as it was prophesied.​” —Matthew 11:29”</em> (Jehovah’s Witnesses)<br><br>

            By these means, they go on to interpret the greater fulfillment of the prophecy in this way:<br><br>

            The great tree represents God’s rulership, just as it symbolized King Nebuchadnezzar’s.  The chopping down of the tree represents the “period during which God allowed the nations to rule over the earth without interference from any kingdom that he had set up.”
            The “seven times” that the tree was banded over began in 607 BCE, when Jerusalem was destroyed.<br><br>

            The “seven times” can be likened to seven years of 360 days, using biblical principles as found in Revelation 12:6, 14 (comparing 1260 days to 3 ½ times), Numbers 14:34, and Ezekiel 4:6 (both comparing a day to a year in a prophetic sense).<br><br>
            By this logic, the seven times would equal 2520 years, and if they began with the destruction of Jerusalem in 607 BCE (as calculated by Jehovah’s Witnesses), these times would end in 1914 CE (note that there is no “0 year” in the BCE-CE system).<br><br>

            <strong>THE “GREATER FULFILLMENT” - IS IT ACCURATE?</strong><br><br>

            While the “greater fulfillment” of the prophecy in Daniel chapter four is never explicitly stated in the Bible, it does resemble the biblical literary technique of dual fulfillment. Some interpreters have understood the prophecy symbolically as pointing to the humbling of world powers before the establishment of God’s Kingdom.<br><br>
            The interpretation that ties this fulfillment to 1914, however, is unique to Jehovah’s Witnesses and is not accepted by most scholars. One main reason is chronology: the destruction of Jerusalem is generally dated to about 587/586 BCE, not 607 BCE. Using 607 BCE as a starting point would place the end of the “Gentile Times” in 1934 rather than 1914—a year with no apparent historical significance.<br><br>

            Scholars also raise doubts about whether Nebuchadnezzar could have experienced a prolonged period of insanity. The Anchor Bible notes: <br><br>
            <em>“Enough is known of Nebuchadnezzar’s 43-year reign so that it is impossible to fit in such a period of insanity”</em> (Hartman and Di Lella 1978). <br><br>
            
            Still, some ancient texts invite comparison. Babylonian tablet BM 34113 cryptically mentions unusual events in the king’s life, and a Qumran papyrus (4Q242) records a prayer by Nabonidus, another Babylonian king, who describes a seven-year illness. This fragment is striking because it involves a king afflicted by a divinely caused malady and treated by a Jewish exile—details that parallel those in Daniel 4. The difficulty, however, is that the text names Nabonidus, not Nebuchadnezzar. Confusion may have arisen since both names derive from the deity Nabu, and later sources, such as Herodotus, referred to different Babylonian kings with the same name, Labynetos (McKoy).<br><br>

            Finally, the phrase “seven times” in Daniel is ambiguous, as the Aramaic term can be interpreted to mean “months,” “seasons,” or “years.” While “years” has often been assumed in symbolic interpretations, the text itself does not specify this.  Connecting this phrase to the day-for-a-year principle extends the prophecy beyond what the text itself supports.<br><br>

            Most historians doubt that Nebuchadnezzar could have experienced a literal seven-year period of insanity, since no such gap appears in his reign. The phrase ‘seven times’ is better understood as a symbolic or indeterminate period, not a precise historical duration.<br><br>


            <strong>CONCLUSION OF THE MATTER</strong><br><br>
            In conclusion, archaeological evidence supports ~587 BCE as the year Jerusalem was destroyed. While the original prophecy recorded at Jeremiah 25:10 (as well as other connected accounts) seems to connect the seventy-year prophecy to Judah’s literal desolation, both historical evidence and a careful reading of the biblical text indicate that this period is best understood as a symbolic period of Babylonian dominance over Judah and neighboring nations, representing exile and subjection rather than seventy years of continuous desolation.<br><br>

            The interpretation by Jehovah’s Witnesses, which treats the seventy years as literal desolation, reads the “times” in Daniel 4 as literal years and applies the day-for-a-year principle to this time period, goes beyond what the text itself supports and lacks corroboration from historical and linguistic evidence.<br><br>

            Historical evidence and Biblical interpretation are meant to be used in harmony, not in opposition.<br><br>

            <strong>FINAL THOUGHTS</strong><br><br>

            As may have been predicted, this paper was written by a Bible student raised as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, who later began to re-examine the beliefs he had long accepted as absolute truth. During his studies, he encountered evidence suggesting that certain teachings he had grown up with might not align with the historical or biblical record. Over the course of many hours of research, he utilized tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT to compare material from official JW sources with that of academic publications and scholarly consensus. Most importantly, he sought to approach the Bible itself with as much neutrality as possible, aiming to read its words without bringing institutional assumptions to bear.<br><br>
            Through this process, he came to see that faith is rarely a simple matter of black and white. Instead, it exists in a complex gray area where interpretation often shapes and complicates what is regarded as truth.<br><br>

            <em>“For an abundance of wisdom brings an abundance of frustration, so that whoever increases knowledge increases pain.”</em> - Ecclesiastes 1:18, NWT<br><br>

            While Watchtower doctrine includes interpretations that many modern scholars dispute, Jehovah’s Witnesses nonetheless represent a unique, unified worldwide community. Their emphasis on mutual love and support is notable, and their lifestyle reflects a moral code that, in many respects, closely aligns with biblical standards.<br><br>

            Ultimately, it is up to each reader to determine how to balance these realities. Some conclude that the doctrinal issues underlying Witness beliefs outweigh the unity and ethical conduct found within the organization. Others feel that, though the doctrine is imperfect, the love and peace cultivated among its members point to something of genuine value.<br><br>

            What is certain is that Christianity centers on faith in Jesus Christ, and the recognition that salvation comes through him. The Bible does not specify that this must be mediated through any particular human organization.<br><br>

            <em>“But I want you to know that the head of every man is the Christ”</em> (1 Corinthians 11:3, NWT).<br><br>

            Thus, the head of man is Christ, not an institution. Each individual must consider both the information presented here and their own experiences as they continue their personal journey of faith.<br><br>
