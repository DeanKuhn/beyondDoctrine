            <h4>A rant about truth, freedom, love, and comfort.  <em>Part one.</em><br><br><hr>

                Welcome to my thought rant.  Don't take this too seriously.<br><br>

                While engaged in a deep conversation with ChatGPT, 
                I was asked (by the AI) to pick between the following:<br><br>

                <ol>
                    <li><span style="background-color: blue; color: skyblue; padding: 4px; border-radius: 4px;">Truth</span></li><br>
                    <li><span style="background-color: red; color: pink; padding: 4px; border-radius: 4px;">Freedom</span></li><br>
                    <li><span style="background-color: green; color: lime; padding: 4px; border-radius: 4px;">Love</span></li><br>
                    <li><span style="background-color: Gold; color: brown; padding: 4px; border-radius: 4px;">Comfort</span></li><br>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p style="max-width: 600px">

                You can only have one—which will you choose?<br><br>

                I couldn’t make a decision.  Each one appealed to me in its own way.  Each one also leads to suffering in its own way.<br><br>

                Truth is brutal.  As a wise man once said, “In much wisdom there is much sorrow.  As knowledge increases, grief increases.”  Seeing the cracks in the world around you will make you realize you’re standing on the top of an egg about to hatch.  You can either wallow in the misery of a futile life or pretend life has meaning long enough for your brain to trick itself into forming a purpose from thin air.<br><br>

                Freedom was the option I chose.  As it turns out, freedom is worse than it sounds.  Freedom is lonely.  Freedom is, for the most part, an illusion.<br><br>

                <br>Scientists have proven that your brain makes basic decisions before your conscience is even aware that you did so.  Once your conscience catches up with your brain, it usually narrates something along the lines of, “Yes, picking the blue shirt instead of the red one was my decision,” when in reality, your brain had decided that some time ago.<br><br>

                A popular experiment showcasing these results was performed by Benjamin Libet.  I encourage you to look into it.  This experiment sparked a series of similar ones.  Patients were asked to flick their wrists whenever they wanted, or to choose between right and left.  The results consistently showed that the brain’s neurons revealed their choice long before their conscience narrated the decision for them.  And by “long time,” I mean maybe a half second.<br><br>

                Even more fascinating are the so-called “half-brain” experiments done on patients with epilepsy.  By severing the corpus callosum (no clue what that is), doctors were able to stop seizures from spreading between hemispheres.<br><br>

                While the medical advancement was positive on the seizure side, free will took a punch to the liver.<br><br>

                By severing the two halves of the brain, the two sides couldn’t properly “talk” to each other.  Each side eventually gained its own agenda.  For example, the right eye and left eye see separately, and communicate through this corpus callosum.  However, in patients where this part of the brain was severed, the brain couldn’t properly communicate with each side.<br><br>

                So, if the right hemisphere saw a snow scene, and the left hemisphere was shown a chicken coop, and the patient was asked to pick between a series of related objects (say, a shovel, chicken, etc.), they may be inclined to choose a shovel, since one scene involved snow.<br><br>

                However, the left hemisphere had never seen that snow scene.  And the left hemisphere controls language processing and logical thinking.  When asked why the patient chose a shovel when the left hemisphere clearly saw a chicken coop, the patient tended to confidently respond with reasoning along the lines of, “Well, you need a shovel to shovel out the chicken coop.”<br><br>

                The scary part is that this line of reasoning is completely fabricated from the left hemisphere, which never actually saw the right hemisphere’s image.  What originally started as a medical study on epilepsy turned into split-brain experiments exposing how behavior and reasoning got bizarrely divorced from conscious awareness.<br><br>

                When scientists noticed that the left hemisphere confidently invented reasons for actions it wasn’t in control of, they were shocked.  All of a sudden, the neat idea of free will that humans have been clutching on to for millenia got a lot messier.<br><br>

                (for more information, look up the split-brain experiments performed by Roger Sperry and Michael Gazzaniga)
