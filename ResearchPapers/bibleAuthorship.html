                    Admittedly, the second table tends to take authorship more conservatively.  For example, there is a good chance that Peter truly did write 1 Peter (or at least, he did through a scribe).  At the same time, there is no hard evidence to back up this claim.  So, technically, the authorship is not known.  Soon to be added is an article explaining why the authorship of the epistles is so highly debated.
                    <br><br>
                    For now, if you'd like, you can read an article I wrote summing how the Pentateuch was likely written, and what in the world the letters J, E, P, and D have to do this this.
